Subject:
- Person: The product manager is a clean-shaven male, with a focused expression. He has short, dark hair and is dressed in a smart-casual outfit—perhaps a button-up shirt.
- Posture: He’s sitting upright at his desk, facing a computer screen. His posture is professional but relaxed, with one hand on the mouse and the other near the keyboard, engaged with the data visualization on the screen.

Desk and Screen:
- Computer Screen: Screen shows data visualizations—such as bar charts, pie charts, or trend graphs.
- Desk: The desk is clean and organized, with a few essential items like a notebook, a coffee mug, and perhaps a stylus or pen. It also has a couple of sticky notes.

Background:
- Clock: A small clock on the wall, maybe a minimalist design, showing the time in a subtle manner. This can hint at the work-focused environment without distracting too much from the main focus.
- Wireframe Diagrams: On the wall, there’s a set of wireframe diagrams for a website or app, pinned up in a grid or arranged in a flow. These wireframes showcase various stages of UI design.
- Process Diagram: A process flowchart on a whiteboard, with arrows and stages of a product development cycle—perhaps showcasing stages like "Ideation," "Prototyping," "Testing," and "Launch."
- Whiteboard: The whiteboard also includes handwritten notes or post-its about sprint deadlines or team goals.  Soft ambient lighting, possibly coming from a desk lamp
